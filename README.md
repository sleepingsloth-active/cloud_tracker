# Cloud Tracker â€“ Satellite Image Analysis

Cloud Tracker is a Python project to analyze cloud movement using satellite images. It generates **motion vectors, heatmaps, and cloud masks** to visualize cloud changes over time.

---

## Features
- Automatic download of satellite images for a specified location
- Detects and visualizes **cloud motion** using optical flow
- Generates:
  - Motion Vectors (highlighting significant movements)
  - Heatmaps (movement intensity)
  - Cloud Masks (cloud coverage)
- Combines all visualizations into a single panel for easy analysis
